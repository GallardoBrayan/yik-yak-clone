ES5 is conventional javascript
React uses ES6

In order to install react into a project you need to install

in order to run the react code you have to run webpack
npx webpack

react
    npm i -S react
    react-dom

npm i -S react-dom
    takes your react code and binds it to the dom
    react native doesnâ€™t use react-dom

webpack
    npm install webpack-cli --save-dev
    webpack runs a bundle task
babel
    react babel and preset
    npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev
    Babel is a transpiler to transpile ES6 to ES5 but these babel tasks need to be run by webpack
